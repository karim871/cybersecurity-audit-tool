## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Linux/macOS (Windows WSL supported)
- Root/sudo access for low port scanning (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karim871/cybersecurity-audit-tool.git
cd cybersecurity-audit-tool

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python src/main.py --help
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan localhost (always test here first!)
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-1000

# Fast scan with 500 concurrent workers
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-1000 -w 500

# Verbose output with progress
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-500 -v

# Save results to JSON report
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-65535 -o reports/full_scan.json
```

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Scan Specific Ports
```bash
# Check web and database ports
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 80,443,3306,5432,27017 -v
```

### Quick Security Audit
```bash
# Scan common vulnerable services
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 21,22,23,25,445,3389 -v
```

### Full Network Scan
```bash
# Comprehensive scan with report (takes ~2-3 minutes)
python src/main.py 127.0.0.1 -p 1-65535 -w 500 -o reports/full_audit.json
```

### Custom Timeout
```bash
# Slower, more accurate scan for unstable networks
python src/main.py 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1000 -t 2.0 -v
```

## 🔒 Security & Legal Notice

⚠️ **IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE**

This tool is for **educational purposes** and **authorized security testing only**.

### ✅ Legal Use Cases:
- Your own systems (localhost, personal VMs)
- Authorized penetration testing with written permission
- Academic research in controlled environments
- Security training labs (HackTheBox, TryHackMe)
- Explicitly permitted targets (e.g., scanme.nmap.org)

### ❌ NEVER Scan:
- Systems you don't own
- Networks without explicit written authorization
- Production environments without approval
- Any system where scanning violates terms of service

**Unauthorized network scanning is illegal in most jurisdictions and can result in criminal prosecution.**
